tree is a heirarchial non linear data structure 
tree has mainlyb 2 elements parent and a child 
a node with respect to its upper node will become a child or granchild
a node with respect to its lower or below nodes will become a parent or ancestor
The number of levels of heirachial structure is known as the height of that tree
# Binary Tree
A tree with atmost of 2 children is known as Binary tree
There are mainly five types of Binary trees
Full Binary tree
A tree which is having 2 or 0 children is known as a full binary tree
Complete Binary tree
a tree which is having all the levels filled except the last level
but in the last level all the elements are need to be at the left side
balanced binary tree
a tree which is having an height of log(n) 
perfect binary tree
All the child nodes need to be at the same level then that is called as a perfect binary tree
Degenerate tree
all the nodes need to be have only 1 or 0 child
